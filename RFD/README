This code accompanies our KDD 2012 Paper.  If you use the code, please cite:

This package contains two different versions of our code, for matlab and python.  

Note that the matlab code is rough and has limited documentation.  We recommend using the python code, as it is significantly cleaner and clearer, with full documentation, more parameter options, faster execution and multithreading support.
